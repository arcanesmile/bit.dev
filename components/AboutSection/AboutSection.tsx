         I'm a Full-Stack Developer with strong experience building modern, scalable, and user-focused web applications. I work across the full development lifecycle using technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Laravel, MongoDB, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS to deliver clean, reliable, and production-ready solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I bring a practical, results-oriented approach to software development—translating business and product requirements into well-architected systems with intuitive user interfaces and efficient backend logic. I am skilled in API design, database modeling, authentication systems, and performance optimization, and I write maintainable, testable code that scales with product growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am a fast learner with a strong work ethic and a consistent track record of shipping complete features and projects independently. I thrive in collaborative environments, communicate clearly with technical and non-technical stakeholders, and take full ownership of tasks from concept through deployment.
